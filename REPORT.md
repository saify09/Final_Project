## Acknowledgment
I would like to express my gratitude to Saylani Mass IT Training (SMIT) for providing an excellent platform to develop modern AI and Data Science skills. I am thankful to my instructors and mentors who guided me throughout the course.

## Abstract
EduBuddy is an offline-first AI-powered learning companion designed to assist students in reading, understanding, and analyzing study materials using NLP, LLMs, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, OCR, Time Series Forecasting, and Visual Analytics.

## Introduction
AI and Data Science have transformed student learning. EduBuddy provides an AI-driven study environment that operates offline, solving issues of connectivity and digital distraction.

## Problem Statement
Students struggle with large volumes of content and lack tools for summarization, revision, and prediction. EduBuddy addresses these challenges with offline AI capabilities.

## Objectives
1.  Build a RAG-based retrieval pipeline.
2.  Extract text from PDFs, images, handwritten notes, and videos.
3.  Generate summaries, quizzes, and flashcards.
4.  Predict outcomes using forecasting techniques.
5.  Deploy dashboards with interactive UI.

## Literature Review
Technologies such as Transformers, CNNs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have improved AI-driven learning systems. Offline AI is increasingly relevant in regions with limited internet access.

## Methodology
EduBuddy uses:
1.  **Data Ingestion:** OCR & vision models for notes and PDFs.
2.  **Preprocessing:** NLP-based cleaning and tokenization.
3.  **Embeddings:** Sentence Transformers for semantic encoding.
4.  **RAG:** Context-based response generator.
5.  **Forecasting:** Predictive models for study outcomes.

## System Architecture
Core modules:
*   Document Processor
*   Vector Database & Embeddings
*   RAG Engine
*   OCR Pipeline
*   Summary Generator
*   Predictive Analytics
*   Dashboard UI

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, OpenCV, OCR, FAISS, Django, Flask, Streamlit, Sentence Transformers.

## Results
EduBuddy has successfully achieved its core objectives. The system efficiently ingests PDFs, images, and videos, extracting text with high accuracy using OCR. The RAG pipeline retrieves relevant context to answer student queries, and the predictive analytics engine forecasts learning outcomes with reasonable precision. The new Glassmorphism UI provides a premium, user-friendly experience.

## Future Work
1.  **Cloud Sync & Collaboration:** Enable data synchronization across devices and peer-to-peer note sharing.
2.  **Voice Interface:** Integrate Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) for a fully conversational, hands-free experience.
3.  **Mobile Application:** Develop a dedicated mobile app (Flutter/React Native) for on-the-go learning.
4.  **Reinforcement Learning:** Implement RL agents to dynamically adjust quiz difficulty based on student performance.
5.  **Multi-Language Support:** Expand support to local languages (e.g., Urdu) to increase accessibility.
    
## Conclusion
EduBuddy integrates NLP, ML, CV, Time-Series analysis, and RAG to create a modern offline-first AI learning ecosystem. By solving the challenges of connectivity and content overload, it significantly enhances student productivity and learning outcomes.
