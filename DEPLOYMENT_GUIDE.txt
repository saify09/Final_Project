    - Refresh the page. Streamlit Cloud sometimes sleeps inactive apps.
    - If you see an error, click "Manage App" -> "Reboot App".

*   **"ModuleNotFoundError"?**
    - This usually means a dependency is missing. The current build includes all necessary libraries (fpdf, opencv, etc.) in `requirements.txt` and system packages in `packages.txt`.

*   **Slow Responses?**
    - The app runs on a free cloud tier. Large PDF processing or video OCR might take a few moments. Please be patient.
